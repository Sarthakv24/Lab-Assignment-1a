This project simulates a metro system with functionalities for user
management and journey
planning. It uses basic data structures and algorithms to handle user
operations and find
routes between stations.
Workflow
Initialization and User Interaction:
The program starts by displaying a welcome message and metro system
map.
Users are prompted to either log in or sign up.
User Management:
If logging in, users provide credentials, and the system verifies them.
If signing up, the system generates a new user ID and card number, then
stores this
information.
Journey Planning:
Users can query routes between stations.
The program offers multiple route options based on:
All possible paths.
Path with the maximum number of stations.
Path with the minimum number of stations.
Shortest distance.
Path crossing a specified station.
Fare Calculation:
The program calculates the fare based on the distance between stations.
It checks the user&#39;s balance and prompts for an update if necessary.
Display Results:
The system displays the selected path, distance, estimated travel time, and
fare.
Updates the user&#39;s balance after fare deduction.
Summary
This metro system project integrates user management with journey
planning functionalities
using graph algorithms. It demonstrates the use of C++ standard libraries,
file handling, and
fundamental algorithms to create a simple yet functional metro simulation
system.
